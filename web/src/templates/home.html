           For Individual assignment 3 I did several things. To satisfy the principe of visibility, 
           I made the links to my other pages much clearer for customers to learn more about our product. 
           I also added a tag line of "Your Car Is Not Safe" for the principle of Role Expressiveness so users
           can understand the context for why they may be on our webpage. 
           To meet the principle of Secondary Notation, I hope to encourage customers to learn more about our product
           by clicking the links to the product and kvp pages.

                  This would be the basic login for a CarProtect User.

                  This would be an example of what the CarProtect User would see once they logged into their account.
                  Besides basic details about their car, they would be able to possibly notify police if CarProtect hadn't already 
                  in addition to notifying close friends, having a live camera feed from CarProtect, and a way to find your car
                  with the sim card and location connectivity.

              <h4>Laws of UI Design</h4>
              <div>
                To satify Hick's law, we have kept the number of buttons and information on the app limited to keep customers from 
                becoming distracted with complex options.
                To satify the law of Proximity, we have the basic carProtect information displayed, with the additional features on the
                bottom left side of the screen with the emergency buttons on the bottom right side. We have kept similar features grouped
                together.
                In combination with the law of Proximity, to satify Miller's law we have kept the amount of information on both the webapp
                and the eventual android app to have as little information as needed on screen while still providing all the functionality
                we want. We can do this by placing larger operations or features as buttons and grouping them as we did.
